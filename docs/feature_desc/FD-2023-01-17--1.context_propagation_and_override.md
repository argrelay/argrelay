feature_title: context propagation and override

TODO: Name the concept of context by two words. Maybe `args_context`? TODO: Because plural `args_` is easily singular `arg_`, to simplify refactoring, rename `args_context` -> ?
TODO: Figure out how to deal with over-specified context.
      How to solve problem when context arg type = arg value entry hides `data_envelopes`
      (which do not contain such entry) from search results?
      Temporary approach:

The context represents "assigned" arg types, an arg type = arg value list.

For example, a pre-set list of arg type = arg value could be specifying some dev environment:
*   `CodeMaturity` = dev
*   `FlowStage` = upstream
*   `GeoRegion` = apac

Each arg type = arg value entry in the context has associated meta data:

*   `ArgSource`: where the value comes from.

     Effectively, it specifies priority (whether another source can override) it.

     For example, `ExplicitArg` overrides any other `ArgSource.*`.

*   Last modification actor: who changed this arg type = arg value entry.

Each arg type = arg value entry in the context can be manipulated:
*   Added if it did not exist yet.
*   Overridden if it already existed (if prev `ArgSource` had higher priority of the next one)
*   Removed if it already existed.
