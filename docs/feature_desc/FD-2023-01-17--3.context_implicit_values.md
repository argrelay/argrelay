feature_title: context implicit values

`args_context` is new for each command line section.


When `FuncArgsInterp` interrogates user for multiple `data_envelope`,
subsequent envelopes may inherit context from previous `data_envelope` queries.

Initial idea / example:

*   When `data_envelope` of `ServiceEnvelopeClass.ClassCluster` is found,
    it has its "coordinates" arg types:

    *   `CodeMaturity`
    *   `FlowStage`
    *   `GeoRegion`
    *   `ClusterName`

*   First, there is no point to specify all arg types if fewer number of them already single out the `data_envelope`.

*   Second, according to `FD-2023-01-17--1`,
    some of these values should provide necessary `args_context` for the next `data_envelope`.

### Solution ###

For all arg types in `args_context` which have its values set by singled out `data_envelope`,
they should be marked with `ArgSource.ImplicitValue`.
