TODO: this was written ahead of the implementation - fix description.

When some args narrow down possible selection,
then "incompatible" with that selection value appear on the command line,
it should not be skipped (as it does not match pre-filtered value set for
that next `ArgType`).

For example:

```
some_command goto upstream qa apac |
```

If `upstream` already narrows down the results which exclude `qa`
(e.g. they include `dev` instead), the `ArgValue` for `ArgType.CodeMaturity`
should be forced-assigned to `qa` instead.

But there should be metadata indicating how this value was decided:
*   `ValueScope.QueriedData`
*   `ValueScope.EntireValueSpace`
