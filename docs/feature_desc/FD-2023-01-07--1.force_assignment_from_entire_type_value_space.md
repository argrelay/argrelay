feature_title: force-assignment from entire type value space
---
TODO: This was written ahead of the implementation - fix description when implemented.
TODO: This feature is actually special case of FD-2023-01-17--1 (context propagation and overrides).

When some args narrow down possible selection,
then "incompatible" with that selection value appear on the command line,
it should not be skipped (as it does not match pre-filtered value set for
that next `ArgType`).

For example:

```
some_command goto upstream qa apac |
```

If `upstream` already narrows down the results which exclude `qa`
(e.g. they include `dev` instead), the `arg_value` for `ArgType.CodeMaturity`
should be forced-assigned to `qa` instead.

But there should be a meta data indicating how this new (overriding) `qa` value was decided:
*   `ValueScope.QueriedData` = value taken from a search result with singled out `data_envelope`.
*   `ValueScope.EntireValueSpace` = value taken from an arg matching one of the values.

Note the difference:
*   Such value cannot be possibly proposed (as there would be no matching envelope).
*   But it can be manually specified (which will make command line useless unless more changes are done).
