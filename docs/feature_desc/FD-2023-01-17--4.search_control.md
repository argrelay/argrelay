TODO: Clarify, add examples, provide details.

Key `search_control` of any `data_envelope` points to an object which describes for `FuncArgsInterp`
how to query required `envelope_class` based on `args_context`.

See also `SearchControlSchema`.

Basically, `search_control` lists arg types (not arg values) which values will be
taken from the `args_context` to search for the `data_envelope`.

Not all entries in `args_context` are used to search objects.
For example, `AccessType` (`ro` or `rw`) can be specified on the command line, but should not be used
to search `data_envelope`-s simply because this arg type is not used as coordinate
(no such arg type in `data_envelope`).

TODO: Who decides what goes into `search_control`: config, data, plugin? Probably all.
      However, current solution is to simply use data - see `SearchControlSchema`.

Immediately targeted use case:
*   `FuncArgsInterp` uses `search_control` (see `function_search_control`) to query for the function.
*   Then function envelope specifies `search_control` for all its `data_envelope`-s it needs to single out.
