TODO: TODO_61_99_68_90: figure out what to do with explicit `envelope_class` `search_prop`

As of now, by default, all `data_envelope`-s of the same `envelope_class` are stored into their own collection.

Issues:

*   This makes specifying `envelope_class` field in `search_prop`-s redundant.

    It holds the same value for all 

*   In the `enum` output, the value of `envelope_class` duplicated.

    It is shown for both `collection_name` and `envelope_class`.

*   Simply removing it from `search_prop`-s cannot be done in general.

    It is required to be searched in cases of multiple classes stored in the same collection.

    See `props_to_values_dict` used by FS_46_96_59_05 `init_control` to select specific `class_name`.
