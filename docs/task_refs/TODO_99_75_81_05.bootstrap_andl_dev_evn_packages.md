Rethink FS_85_33_46_53 bootstrap:
*   It should deploy only what was previously captured in `dev_env_packages.txt`.
*   Only `pip` should change package list / versions (and boostrap can store it into `dev_env_packages.txt`).
*   However, when `dev_env_packages.txt` does not exist, it should do fresh reinstall.
