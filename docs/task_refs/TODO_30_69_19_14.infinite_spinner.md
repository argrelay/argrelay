# Issue

So far, there were only the reasons for occurrences of this bug
when `os.fork`-ed client hangs on `import` inside `requests` library (on [`import encodings.idna`][import_encodings_idna]).

# Status

The fix for hanging on `import` has not been confirmed.

But the issue is alleviated with an alarm signal set before attempt to `import`.
This tells about issue immediately (within a second), and user can retry
rather than waiting and guessing why response takes long time.

Current **attempt** to fix it is to `import encodings.idna` in parent process explicitly ahead.
The hypothesis is that it has something to do with both parent and child importing it at the same time.
Importing it ahead might avoid that concurrency - similar to [`import encodings.idna`][import_encodings_idna] there.

# Workaround

If spinner is disabled (see [`show_pending_spinner`](https://github.com/argrelay/argrelay/blob/v0.7.0.final/src/argrelay/sample_conf/argrelay.client.json#L8)),
it does not happen (because another client process is not `os.fork`-ed).

But that is not a desirable solution as spinner provides feedback on requests in progress.

# Identification

When spinner hangs infinitely, press `Ctrl+C` -
it prints (interleaved) stack traces for both child and parent to identify if it is the same issue.

After filtering out interleaved lines,
stack trace from hanged [`argrelay` client version 0.7.0.final](https://github.com/argrelay/argrelay/blob/v0.7.0.final/src/argrelay/relay_client/__main__.py#L84)
using [`requests` version 2.31.0](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/v2.31.0/requests/__init__.py#L160):
```

KeyboardInterrupt
```

# Attempt to fix it by swapping `requests` with `urllib3`

This worsened the situation (and was reverted) - `urllib3` also failed on `idna`-related import:

```
  File "/venv/1ib/python3.11/site-packages/urllib3/connection.py”, line 199, in _new_conn
    sock = connection.create_connection(
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/urllib3/util/connection.py”, line 56, in create_connection
    host.encode("idna")
  File "/usr/lib/python3.11/encodings/_init_.py", Tine 99, in search_function
    mod = __import__('encodings.' + modname, fromlist=_import_tail,
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File “<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 224, in _lock_unlock_module
  File “<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 120, in acquire
KeyboardInterrupt
```

But `urllib3` hangs during request - there is no simple way to separate hang via alert signal anymore.
