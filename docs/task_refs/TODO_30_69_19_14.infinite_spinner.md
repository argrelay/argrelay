# Issue

So far, there were only the reasons for occurrences of this bug
when `os.fork`-ed client hangs on `import` inside `requests` library.

# Status

Hang on `import` is not fixed, but alleviated with a timed alarm which tells when `import` hands.

This tells about issue immediately, and user can retry
rather than waiting and guessing why response takes long time.

# Workaround

If spinner is disabled (see [`show_pending_spinner`](https://github.com/argrelay/argrelay/blob/v0.7.0.final/src/argrelay/sample_conf/argrelay.client.json#L8)),
it does not happen (because another client process is not `os.fork`-ed).

But that is not a desirable solution as spinner provides feedback on requests in progress.

# Identification

When spinner hangs infinitely, press `Ctrl+C` -
it prints (interleaved) stack traces for both child and parent to identify if it is the same issue.

After filtering out interleaved lines,
stack trace from hanged [`argrelay` client version 0.7.0.final](https://github.com/argrelay/argrelay/blob/v0.7.0.final/src/argrelay/relay_client/__main__.py#L84)
using [`requests` version 2.31.0](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/v2.31.0/requests/__init__.py#L160):
