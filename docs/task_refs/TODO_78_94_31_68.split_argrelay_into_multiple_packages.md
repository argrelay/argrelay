TODO: TODO_78_94_31_68: split argrelay into multiple packages

The main benefit is to be able to:
*   enforce relationship between packages
*   track semver compatibility easily (see `semver_notes.md`)
*   reuse them without always downloading everything

All packages may continue to reside in the same single repo (mono repo) with some boundaries.

Start by splitting them into separate sub_modules (e.g. server API, server, client, ...).

Keep `argrelay` as an easy to install package for everything at once.

# Components and dependencies

These are some thoughts about splitting:

*   `argrelay_bootstrap`

    Deployment automation for client and server.

*   `argrelay_check_env`

    Everything related to `check_env`.

*   `argrelay_client_app`

    Dependencies:
    *   argrelay_client_config_schema
    *   argrelay_rest_api

*   `argrelay_client_config_schema`

    Config content schema and file paths for the client.

*   `argrelay_core_config_schema`

    Common stuff in config schema shared between client and server.

    What are the examples?

*   `argrelay_delegator_api`

    Interfaces between server and delegator plugins.

*   `argrelay_rest_api`

    Interfaces between client and server for request-response.

*   `argrelay_server_app`

    Dependencies:
    *   `argrelay_server_config_schema`
    *   `argrelay_rest_api`

*   argrelay_server_config_schema

    Config content schema and file paths for the client.

*   `argrelay_utils`

    Anything shared between client and server.
