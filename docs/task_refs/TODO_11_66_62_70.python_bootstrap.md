TODO: TODO_11_66_62_70: python_bootstrap: bootstrap written in Python

This task replaces the bootstrap script written in Bash to bootstrap written in Python.

*   Currently, it is an experimental alternative to [FS_85_33_46_53.bootstrap_env.md][FS_85_33_46_53.bootstrap_env.md].
*   Eventually, it should replace it.

## Use cases

*   [bootstrap_procedure.1.project_creation.md][bootstrap_procedure.1.project_creation.md]

    *   Download `bootstrap_env.py`.
    *   Run `bootstrap_env.py` which performs `init_env` (and beyond).

*   [bootstrap_procedure.2.initial_installation.md][bootstrap_procedure.2.initial_installation.md]

    *   Run `bootstrap_env.py` which performs `init_env` (and beyond).

*   [bootstrap_procedure.3.argrelay_upgrade.md][bootstrap_procedure.3.argrelay_upgrade.md]

    *   Do the necessary (as described by the doc) to allow `argrelay` upgrade.
    *   Run `bootstrap_env.py` which performs `init_env` (and beyond).

*   `init_env` (and beyond)

    This is all `boostrap_env.py` is supposed to do -
    see bootstrap stages in [FS_28_84_41_40.flexible_bootstrap.md][FS_28_84_41_40.flexible_bootstrap.md].

## Spec for `@/exe/boostrap_env.py`

These are the key steps of bootstrap implementation.

### init `@/conf`

Steps:

*   Ensure current directory is `argrelay_dir`.

*   If `@/conf` does not exist and the path to conf dir is not provided, fail.

*   If `@/conf` does not exist and the path to conf dir is provided, create symlink to that dir.

*   If `@/conf` exists, ensure it is a symlink.

### init `venv`

There are 3 different `python` interpreter paths to deal with:

1.  path used to run `@/exe/bootstrap_env.py`
2.  path required by user in `@/conf/python_env.path_to_python.conf.txt`
3.  path under `venv`

The bootstrap process has to be able to:
*   transition from 1 to 2
*   avoid transition from 3 to 2

Steps:

*   If `@/conf/path_to_python` file does not exist, write there the path of the current Python interpreter.

*   If `@/conf/path_to_python` file exists and the path of the current Python interpreter matches its content:

    Continue executing: this is the interpreter selected by the user.

    To change this decision, the user has to remove `@/conf/path_to_python` and\
    re-run bootstrap with the required interpreter:

    ```sh
    path/to/python/interperter ./exe/bootstrap_env.py
    ```

*   If `@/conf/path_to_python` file exists and the path of the current Python interpreter does not match its content:

    Run `@/exe/boostrap_env.py` recursively with the required interpreter from that file.

*   Check that the Python version is above the min supported.

## Python advantages

*   Code is independent of target shell (e.g. `bash`, `zsh`, ...).

    Instead, it can generate required files for any of the shells.

    Better support for [FS_69_15_45_21.template_instantiator.md][FS_69_15_45_21.template_instantiator.md].

*   No need to configure Python manually by the user.

    Bootstrap configures the same Python interpreter it is started with.

    In other words, `@/conf/python_env.conf.bash` can be generated.

*   Test-ability - `bash` scripts are hardly test-able.

    There is simply not practice to write tests for `bash` scripts.

*   Trace-ability - failures do not produce stack traces in `bash`.

    Lack of trace-ability and test-ability encourage excessive logging for `bash` scripts.

*   More readable code than in shell scripts.

*   Avoid initializing automatic error detection for sub-shell (e.g. `set -euo pipefail`).

*   Better control of local versus global variables.

*   No issues with `return` versus `exit` (for `sourced` versus stand-alone scripts).

*   Rich functionality for [FS_28_84_41_40.flexible_bootstrap.md][FS_28_84_41_40.flexible_bootstrap.md].
