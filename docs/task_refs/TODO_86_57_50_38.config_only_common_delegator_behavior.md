Actually, this applies to behavior of any delegator (config-only or not)
because config-only uses same common APIs just being able to be configured.

For example:

*   If delegator cannot work with non-singled-out `data_envelop` and needs to fail with proper error
    (rather than exception), provide configuration for such behaviors.

*   If delegator (or specific funct) is supposed to fail on unconsumed/unrecognized/remaining arg,
    it this can be part of common support by the framework.

This makes some of the behavior of FS_49_96_50_77 config-only plugins available for any plugins.
