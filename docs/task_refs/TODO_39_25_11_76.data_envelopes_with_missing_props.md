TODO_39_25_11_76: `data_envelope`-s with missing props

# Scenario

*   Multiple `data_envelope`-s loaded under the same `ReservedArgType.EnvelopeClass`.
*   The `search_control` used to query them contains `some_prop_x` prop.
*   This `some_prop_x` exists in some `data_envelope`-s and does not exist in others.

# Issue

Those `data_envelope`-s which have `some_prop_x` will hide those which do not while narrowing down the search.

Why?

*   Function `EnvelopeContainer.populate_implicit_arg_values` will assign singled out value of `some_prop_x`.

    Note that `None`/`null` or blank values are not included (FS_99_81_19_25: no space in options).

*   The next query will not return `data_envelope`-s which do not have `some_prop_x`.

This is currently considered to be a data issue (not easily fix-able in `argrelay`)
which can be easily prevented by loaders by always assigning some `UNKNOWN` value.
