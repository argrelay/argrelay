TODO: TODO_66_66_75_78: Split `arg` to `prop` concepts:
*   `arg` is about command line input
*   `prop` is about search, envelopes, data backend

We map `arg` from command line to `prop` for search.

Split:
*   "arg" group of concepts (`arg_value`, `arg_type`)
*   "prop" group of concepts (`prop_value`, `prop_name`)

Note: there seems to be no way to tell `arg_type` until `arg_value` is matched as a value for some `prop_name`.

In fact, all `command_line`-level concept (like `key`, `arg_bucket`, etc.) have to be clearly distinguished
from data backend concepts (like `collection_name` and `prop`-s) even though they are closely related via mapping.

Issue:
*   `command_line` args are mapped to `data_envelope` props and almost identical
*   BUT: they are not naturally/intuitively inter-change-able as `data_envelope` properties are hardly `command_line` arguments.
*   Maybe write doc on bounded contexts? Add dictionaries (ubiquitous language) per bash, client, server, data backend?
