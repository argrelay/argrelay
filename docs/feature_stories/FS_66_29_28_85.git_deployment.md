feature_title: `git_deployment`
feature_status: OBSOLETE

This feature is obsoleted by FS_85_33_46_53 `bootstrap_venv`.

*   For `pip_deployment` see FS_90_56_42_04.
*   See `dev_env_and_target_env_diff.md` for comparison.

This feature supports `git_deployment` when `argrelay`:
*   either is being developed itself
*   or is in development of another project (integrated with it)

The key difference from `pip_deployment`:
*   deployment runs without pre-activated Python `venv` (e.g. after `git clone` for `argrelay`)
*   the config files provided by the repo should be symlinked
    (to keep committing their changes) rather than copied
