The script is supposed to provide single place to perform multi-level verification.

This script may overlap with functions from FS_85_33_46_53 `bootstrap_dev_env`.

It can start with checking:
*   Python version
*   `venv` existence
*   `argrelay` package existence

Then it jumps into checks implemented in Python (for testability) to verify:
*   whether it is run under FS_58_61_77_69 `dev_shell`
*   whether `PATH` env var reaches client and server binaries
*   whether completion is configured in shell
*   config locations used
*   any useful missing (or useless existing) settings in `~/.inputrc`
*   server availability
*   server version and compatibility
*   prints server instance id and whatever we can query to verify its state
*   print plugin list (serialized DAG) with types and activation status

What else?
