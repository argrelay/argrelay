This feature covers initial setup and upgrades of `argrelay`-integrated projects (their development environments).

Given the target project already created a `venv` and `pip`-installed `argrelay`,<br/>
the idea is to have a single `^/exe/bootstrap_dev_env.bash` script which:
*   Loads `^/conf/python_conf.bash` (or prompts user if it does not exist).
*   Runs project-specific custom `^/exe/deploy_project.bash` (or prompts user if it does not exist).
*   Copies itself into target project from `argrelay` (for future use).
*   Starts itself from target project (again, using a refreshed copy).
*   Runs project-specific custom `^/exe/build_project.bash` (or prompts user if it does not exist).
*   Starts all other scripts.
*   Part of `^/exe/dev_shell.bash`.

Script `^/exe/bootstrap_dev_env.bash` is **not** supposed to be ignored.
Instead, it automatically self-copied from `argrelay.git/src/argrelay/custom_integ_res/bootstrap_dev_env.bash`
and has to be checked into the repo so that it can be re-run to bootstrap the project.
