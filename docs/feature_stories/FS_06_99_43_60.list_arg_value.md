This feature is about "multiple values" (list) vs "single value" per `arg_type`.

Assigning multiple values per `arg_type` is equivalent of placing same `data_envelope`
into multiple coordinates within discrete space.

In other words, `data_envelope` is supposed to be search-able by any of the value from `arg_value` list
for that "coordinate" `arg_type` (logical OR).

TODO: Why do we need that complexity?
      The other approach is to create for all permutations (with values from multiple arrays).
      This effectively places copies of original `data_envelope` to all those places in discrete space.
      Then, when searched, user would need to specify all those coordinates explicitly (to differentiate among copies).
      With support of array fields, these copies disappear, and the search would lock on single object
      as soon as one of the value within array is specified.

TODO: Interrogation for the values to be resolved.
      At this moment, the user is interrogated for one of the values (one enum item from enum set) per `arg_type`.
      What if there are multiple `arg_type` per `data_envelope`?
      Do we still interrogate for one value?
      Or do we interrogate same `arg_type` until there are no more values given the current context?
      It is the problem similar to function varargs (FS_18_64_57_18) - not as `data_evenlope` set, as `arg_type` value set.
      SOLUTION:
      Conceptually, for CLI interrogation, only single value should be given - simply follow existing approach.
      The fact that we want to find an object by "one of N" values (instead of "one of one" value) does not change "one of".
      This may be differently handled in other apps, but that focuses on sensible minimal syntax simple search queries.
