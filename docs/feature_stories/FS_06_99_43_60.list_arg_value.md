This feature is about "multiple values" (list) vs "single value" per `arg_type`.

Assigning multiple values per `arg_type` is equivalent of placing same `data_envelope`
into multiple coordinates within discrete space.

In other words, `data_envelope` is supposed to be search-able by any of the value from `arg_value` list
for that "coordinate" `arg_type` (logical OR).

TODO: Why do we need that complexity?
      The other approach is to create for all permutations (with values from multiple arrays).
      This effectively places copies of original `data_envelope` to all those places in discrete space.
      Then, when searched, user would need to specify all those coordinates explicitly (to differentiate among copies).
      With support of array fields, these copies disappear, and the search would lock on single object
      as soon as one of the value within array is specified.
