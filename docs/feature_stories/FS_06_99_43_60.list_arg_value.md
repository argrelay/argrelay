Assigning multiple values per `arg_type` is equivalent of placing same `data_envelope`
into multiple coordinates within discrete space.

In other words, `data_envelope` is supposed to be search-able by any of the value from `arg_value` list
for that "coordinate" `arg_type` (logical OR).

TODO: Why do we need that complexity?
