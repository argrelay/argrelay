For example, consider "is owned by" relationship between `data_envelope` classes:
a `ServiceEnvelopeClass.ClassCluster` has many `ServiceEnvelopeClass.ClassHost`-s.

When `data_envelope`-s has an "is owned by" relationship (or the like) with another, there are two approaches:

*   A: populate all props identifying owner into ownee:

    `ClassHost` has extra props from `ClassCluster`:

    *   `ServiceArgType.CodeMaturity`
    *   `ServiceArgType.GeoRegion`
    *   `ServiceArgType.FlowStage`
    *   `ServiceArgType.ClusterName`

*   B: populate only owner id prop only:

    `ClassHost` has only `ServiceArgType.ClusterName` prop from `ClassCluster`.

    In this case, these arg types are useless to search `ClassHost`:

    *   `ServiceArgType.CodeMaturity`
    *   `ServiceArgType.GeoRegion`
    *   `ServiceArgType.FlowStage`

   `ClassHost` `data_envelope` simply cannot be found by (`CodeMaturity`, `GeoRegion`, `FlowStage`)<br/>
   until `ServiceArgType.ClusterName` is found by that tuple first.

   In this case, `ClusterName` (owner id) can be propagated as `ArgSource.InitValue` into (ownee) `ClassHost`.

Comparison:

| A: propagate all       | B: propagate id only                                                                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| no limitation          | no `ClassHost` props can be searched until `ClassCluster` is found first                             |
| no limitation          | functions requiring `ClassHost` has to include search for `ClassCluster`                             |
| no limitation          | narrowing down is not possible as `ClassHost` is indexed by exact unique `ClusterName` (one or none) |
| possibly slower search | likely faster search for initial (`CodeMaturity`, `GeoRegion`, `FlowStage`) tuple                    |

Basically, A is almost always a better choice.
