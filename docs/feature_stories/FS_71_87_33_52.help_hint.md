Help hint is a single line explanation which can be shown:
*   next to suggested arg type during completion
*   in listing of `data_envelope`-s found as varargs (FS_06_99_43_60)

While `help_doc` (FS_94_30_49_28) can be shown on request,
`help_hint` shows up automatically during completion.

Implementation will likely involve a separate query
for `help_hints` per arg type.
