There should be a way to configure one server so that it redirects requests to another server.

This is convenient in cases when:
*   some local small server is used for private commands
*   while some big server is used for public commands

TODO: Decide: this redirect can be done by either|or:
*   HTTP 307 response to client by `server_a` (and client request the same thing again by itself from `server_b`)
*   `server_a` on behalf of the same client request contacts to the `server_b`
