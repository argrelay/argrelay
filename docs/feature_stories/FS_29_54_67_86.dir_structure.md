This features describes the structure (a convention):
*   which `argrelay` uses for itself
*   which should be used for integration projects based on `argrelay` (to make scripts re-use-able)

To make it unambiguous that path is relative to repo root or deployment root dir,
it is referred as `argrelay_dir` in scripts and indicated as `^/` in docs and comments,
for example: `^/exe/bootstrap_dev_env.bash`.

Every script knows its relative position to `argrelay_dir` (or `^/`) to derive it.

```

├── docs          # Documentation, notes, etc.
├── src           # Prod code
├── dst           # Target environment configurations (dst = "destination") - see also `^/conf/` dir.
├── tests         # Test code
...
├── conf          # Git-ignored dir for all configuration files specific to the target environment.
│                 # Normally, `^/conf/` dir is a symlink to one of the sub-dirs under `^/dst/`,
│                 # if target environment configurations is decided to be stored in the same repo.

```

# `^/exe/`

Dir `^/exe/` contains immediately executable files.

# `^/conf/`

Dir `^/conf/` contains configuration files specific to target deployment environment.

It is not supposed to be version controlled by this repo.

In practice, to keep its content under version control, it can be a symlink which
points to different version controlled dir depending on the target deployment environment.
To avoid being detected as modified when target deployment environment changes, this symlink
is not committed - instead, it is set to selected dir by deployment scripts.
