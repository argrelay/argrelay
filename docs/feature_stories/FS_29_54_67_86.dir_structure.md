feature_title: project `dir_structure`
feature_status: TEST
---

This features describes the directory structure (a convention):
*   which `argrelay` uses for itself
*   which should be used for integration projects based on `argrelay` (to make scripts re-use-able)

To make it unambiguous that path is relative to project root dir,
it is referred to as `argrelay_dir` in scripts and indicated as `@/` in docs and comments,
for example: `@/exe/bootstrap_dev_env.bash`.

Every script knows its relative position to `argrelay_dir` (or `@/`) to locate it.

Note that project root may or may not match repo root (e.g. Git):
*   it does for `argrelay` itself
*   but it may not for `argrelay`-based projects

# `@/exe/`

Dir `@/exe/` contains immediately executable files.

# `@/conf/`

Dir `@/conf/` contains configuration files specific to target deployment environment.

Normally, it is a symlink.

The symlink itself is not supposed to be version controlled by this repo, but the dir it points to can be:
*   one of `@/dst/*` dirs under the same repo
*   any other dir

In practice, to keep config under version control within the same repo, `@/conf/` can be a symlink which
points to different version controlled dir (see sub-dirs under `@/dst/`) depending on the target deployment environment.

To avoid being detected as modified when target deployment environment changes, this `@/conf/` symlink is not committed.

This path is the default (lowest priority) - see [`FS_16_07_78_84.conf_dir_priority.md`][FS_16_07_78_84.conf_dir_priority.md].

# `@/dst/`

This dir contains sub-dirs with config files for multiple target environments.

For example:
*   Dir `@/dst/` may contain sub-dirs: `@/dst/target_env_a` and `@/dst/target_env_b`.
*   When the project is deployed to environment `target_env_a`, `@/conf/` should be a symlink to `@/dst/target_env_a`.
*   When the project is deployed to environment `target_env_b`, `@/conf/` should be a symlink to `@/dst/target_env_b`.

# `@/exe/bootstrap_dev_env.bash`

See FS_85_33_46_53 `bootstrap_dev_env`.

# `@/exe/dev_shell.bash`

See FS_58_61_77_69 `dev_shell`.

# `@/conf/dev_shell_rc.conf.bash`

It is used by `@/exe/dev_shell.bash`.
