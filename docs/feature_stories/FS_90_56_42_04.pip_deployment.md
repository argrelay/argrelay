feature_title: `pip_deployment`
feature_status: OBSOLETE

This feature is obsoleted by FS_85_33_46_53 `bootstrap_venv`.

*   For `git_deployment` see FS_66_29_28_85.
*   See `dev_env_and_target_env_diff.md` for comparison.

This feature supports `pip_deployment` when `argrelay` is deployed (normally integrated within another project).

The key difference from `git_deployment`:
*   deployment runs with pre-activated Python `venv` (after `pip install` for `argrelay`)
*   the config files provided by the project should be copied
    (to avoid changes to original package) rather than symlinked
