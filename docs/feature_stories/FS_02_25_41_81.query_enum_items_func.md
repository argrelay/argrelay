The feature provides a func to enumerate available arg options (based on existing arg values).

This is one of the funcs listed in FS_80_45_89_81 integrated functions.

It does exactly the same thing as `ServerAction.DescribeLineArgs` invoked on `Alt+Shift+Q`,
but when it is invoked as function, it is invoked via `Enter` (`ServerAction.RelayLineArgs`).

Historically, verb "describe" was used for this functionality, but "enum" is closer to its meaning
(effectively, available options are sort of dynamic enum whose item set changes with provided args).
