This feature supports quick non-intrusive shell session with configured `argrelay`:
*   quick: single command `@/exe/dev_shell.bash` should do all the necessary steps to set up environment temporarily
*   non-intrusive: user environment is not affected (e.g. no changes to `~/.bashrc`) - only current shell session

See demo from the main [`readme.md`][root_readme.md] how it is used.
