This feature supports quick non-intrusive shell session with configured `argrelay`:
*   quick: single command `dev_shell.bash` should do all the necessary steps to set up environment temporarily
*   non-intrusive: user environment is not affected (e.g. no changes to `~/.bashrc`) - only current shell session

`dev_shell` should be usable for both:
*   `git_deployment` FS_66_29_28_85
*   `pip_deployment` FS_90_56_42_04
