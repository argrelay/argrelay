This feature covers initial deployment and subsequent upgrades of `argrelay`-integrated projects.

Given the target project already created a `venv` and `pip`-installed `argrelay`,<br/>
the idea is to have a single `bootstrap_venv.bash` script which:
*   Loads `python_conf.bash` (or prompts user if it does not exist).
*   Runs `deploy_project.bash` (or prompts user if it does not exist).
*   Copies itself into target project from `argrelay`.
*   Starts itself from target project (refreshed copy).
*   Starts all other scripts.
*   Part of `dev_shell.bash`.
