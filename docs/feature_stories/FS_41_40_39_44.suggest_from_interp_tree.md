feature_title: suggest from interp tree
feature_status: TODO

TODO: When there is no data (including funcs), Tab suggest next step from interp tree (e.g. `subtree`), but Alt+Shift+Q does not show these suggestions.

TODO: Parts of the proposal may be obsoleted by implementing (but need to finalize with tests):
*   FS_01_89_09_24 interp tree
*   FS_26_43_73_72 func tree

This feature is related to FS_01_89_09_24 interp tree.

The feature proposes to have special `arg_type` (special case) which is not based on loaded data,
but based on config of interpreter (FS_01_89_09_24 interp tree).

TODO_49_31_47_63: `query_enum_items_func` func does not exist yet.

For example:

*   When `query_enum_items_func` is called, the `arg_value` lists are composed based on only `search_control`:

    ```
    relay_demo | # Alt+Shift+Q
    ```
    
    ```
    some_command 
    ClassFunction: 6
      FunctionCategory: external [InitValue]
      *ActionType: ? goto desc list
      ObjectSelector: ? host service
    ```

    Function `_contribute_to_completion` is ineffective because `query_enum_items_func` uses
    `ServerAction.ProposeArgValues` and this function checks for:

    ```
    if self.parsed_ctx.server_action == ServerAction.ProposeArgValues:
    ```

*   When args are suggested, the `arg_value` lists includes both:

    *   `arg_value` lists from currently expected `arg_type`
    *   next values based on current tree path as explained in FS_01_89_09_24 interp tree.

    ```
    relay_demo | # Tab
    ```
    
    ```
    intercept help subtree goto desc list
    ```

This feature proposes to invoke contribution to completion all the time,
and use separate field in the output of `query_enum_items_func` to list what is proposed
by the FS_01_89_09_24 interp tree.
