There should be a way to source multiple `@/exe/argrelay_rc.bash` configuring
different commands contacting different servers (different installations) and be able to use them at the same time.

It should also work by nesting `@/exe/dev_shell.bash` for different installations.

For example:
*   `ar_configured_command_a` is auto-completed by `/path/to/argrelay/with/server_a`
*   `ar_configured_command_b` is auto-completed by `/path/to/argrelay/with/server_b`

This should be achieve-able by invoking `@/bin/run_argrelay_client` via its full path
instead of base name (`run_argrelay_client`).
