feature_title: option list on describe with prefix
feature_status: TBD
---

This feature uses FS_23_62_89_43 `tangent_token` to
narrow down enum items listed on `ServerAction.DescribeLineArgs`
(even if tangent token is considered unspecified = not consumed).

Currently, instead of reducing options on `ServerAction.DescribeLineArgs` (as described in this feature below),
prefix highlight (FS_11_87_76_73) is used to alleviate the need for this feature (FS_80_82_13_35).

The point: when `arg_value` is incomplete (its value does not match entirely any enum item),
there is no reduction of options shown in description:

```sh
some_command goto host pro|
```

Actual:

```
...
class_cluster:
  *code_maturity: ? dev qa prod
  ...
```

Expected (ideally):

```
...
class_cluster:
  *code_maturity: ? prod
  ...
```

The suggestion is matches what `ServerAction.RelayLineArgs` sees now (see Actual above)
because unrecognized token does not reduce enum items.

The point of this feature (FS_80_82_13_35) is:

*   So far, `argrelay` does not allow incomplete `arg_value`-s in case of multiple options on invocation.
*   But reducing shown options for a given prefix on `ServerAction.DescribeLineArgs` is also not a completion
    (so, making it work as Expected above for `ServerAction.DescribeLineArgs` will not be a conflict conceptually).

TODO: However, sometimes tangent token matches one of the option exactly, and all options hide because
current becomes `explicit_offered_arg`. Ideally, we want suggestion to match what is proposed, for example:

```
lay goto service tt|
```

Then, description prints this (only one):

```
class_service: 1
  code_maturity: dev [implicit_value]
  flow_stage: downstream [implicit_value]
  geo_region: apac [implicit_value]
  cluster_name: dev-apac-downstream [implicit_value]
  group_label: rrr [implicit_value]
  service_name: tt [explicit_offered_arg]
  host_name: zxcv-dd [implicit_value]
  live_status: ~ [implicit_value]
  data_center: dc.11 [implicit_value]
  ip_address: ip.172.16.1.2 [implicit_value]
```

But suggestion lists these (several):

```
tt   tt1  tt2
```

To match Tab-suggestion list with Alt+Shift+Q list, tangent token should not be considered complete.
