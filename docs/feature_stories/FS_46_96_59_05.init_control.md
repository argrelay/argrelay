This feature computes values for the next `data_envelope` as initial `args_context`:

In order to narrow down the search for the next `data_envelope` quickly,
some (arg type, arg value) pairs can be assigned as `ArgSource.InitValue`-s into the next `args_context`
by `PluginType.DelegatorPlugin` - see usage of `init_control`.
