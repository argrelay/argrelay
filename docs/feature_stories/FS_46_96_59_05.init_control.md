This feature computes values for the next `data_envelope` as initial `args_context`:

In order to narrow down the search for the next `data_envelope` quickly,
some (arg type, arg value) pairs can be assigned as `ArgSource.InitValue`-s into the next `args_context`
by `PluginType.InvocatorPlugin` - see usage of `init_control`.

Although function can decide any initial values,
current solution is to simply use data - see `init_control` key (`DataEnvelopeSchema`) which specifies
what arg types will be set by the (given) prev `data_envelope` into the next one.
