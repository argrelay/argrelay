TODO: It should be implemented via `PluginType.InvocatorPlugin` by providing
      a way to assign some `ArgSource.ComputedValue`.

TODO: This is old description - instead of propagating, use `PluginType.InvocatorPlugin` to compute some values.
      In order to narrow down the search for the next `data_envelope` quickly,
      some (arg type, arg value) pairs from prev `args_context` can be propagated as `ArgSource.ImplicitValue`-s
      into the next `arg_context`.

There are aspects to maintain `ArgSource.ImplicitValue`-s:

*   This feature `FS_62_25_92_06` to computes values for the next `data_envelope` as initial `args_context`:

    These (arg type, arg value) pairs computed based on previously found `data_envelope`
    provide necessary (initial) `args_context` for the next `data_envelope` to find.

    TODO: Who decides what goes into `args_context`: config, data, plugin? Probably all.
          But(!) it is better be function, because function defines what can be computed defaults, not data.
          However, current solution is to simply use data - see `context_control` key (`DataEnvelopeSchema`)
          which specifies what arg types will be set by the (given) prev `data_envelope` into the next one.
    TODO: Instead of each individual `data_envelope` instance, propagation should be implemented by the plugin
          implementing the function - the most flexible yet clear approach (because only function knows that
          is being searched for).

*   For arg values singled out by the search for the current `data_envelope`, see `FS_13_51_07_97`.
