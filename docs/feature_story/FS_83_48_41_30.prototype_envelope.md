Some data is the same for each `data_envelope` of the same `envelope_class`.

TODO: It might be useful to create `prototype_envelope`-s which describe some data for
all instances of specific `envelope_class`.

Common data for all instances of the class, for example:
*   MongoDB index spec
*   `context_control` but it might actually be specific to (function_envelope, envelope_class).
*   `search_control` (FS_83_48_41_30) but this is actually specified per (function_envelope, envelope_class) pair.

TODO: consider prototype
TODO: Or consider various *Provider plugins which compute what kind of
      MongoDB index spec to provide,
      `context_control` to provide based on (function_envelope, envelope_class),
      `search_control` to provide based on (function_envelope, envelope_class),
      etc.
      It is the most flexible way as both code and config are possible.
