feature_title: singled out implicit values
feature_status: TEST
---

When `FuncArgsInterp` interrogates user for `data_envelope` it should skip those arg types,
which are already singled out within current `args_context` (and can be implied as `ArgSource.ImplicitValue`).

Initial idea / example:
When `data_envelope` of `ServiceEnvelopeClass.ClassCluster` is found,
it has its arg types with assigned arg values ("coordinates"):
*   `CodeMaturity`
*   `FlowStage`
*   `GeoRegion`
*   `ClusterName`

There are aspects to maintain `ArgSource.ImplicitValue`-s:

*   This feature `FS_13_51_07_97` to assign singled out values from search results for the current `data_envelope`:

    There is no point to interrogate arg type if it already has arg value singled out by
    currently found `data_envelope` set (all `data_envelope`-s in the set have the same arg value for that arg type).

    All arg types in `args_context` which have its values singled out
    should be marked with `ArgSource.ImplicitValue` for current `data_envelope`.

    TODO: FIX: KI_12_84_57_78: currently, it works only when there is single envelope, not single value for arg type.

*   For initial `args_context` with propagated values from the prev `data_envelope`, see `FS_46_96_59_05`.
