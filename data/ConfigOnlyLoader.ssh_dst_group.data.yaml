# This data is loaded by instance of `ConfigOnlyLoader` for `ssh_dst_group` plugins.
# See `DelegatorSshDst` who consumes this data.
# The data is a small set of objects which can be easily changed manually for demo purposes.
# Each object describes an `ssh` destination augmented by different properties used in
# search and selection of one specific destination via CLI.
# Normally, instead of hard-coding static set, this data is automatically extracted from
# some data source by implementing a specialized loader (see FS_00_13_77_97 plugin framework).

# TODO: FS_20_88_05_60 `dictated_arg`-s are not ready yet:
#       Until then IP addresses are prefixed with `ip.` to separate IP address value space
#       from other properties for selection on CLI.

# TODO: TODO_39_25_11_76: `data_envelope`-s with missing props
#       User is set to "~" (quoted tilda) which is interpreted as `SpecialChar.NoPropValue`.
#       If set to `null` (or other YAML equivalents), it does not pass validation -
#       at the moment, all props must have a non-null non-empty values.
