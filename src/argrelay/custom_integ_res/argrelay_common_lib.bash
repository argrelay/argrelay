# This script is supposed to be sourced by others, not run directly:
[[ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" == "${0}" ]] && exit 1

# This library script expects caller script (the sourcing script) to ensure few things:
# *   `script_source` should be set as:
#     script_source="${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"
#     by the caller.
#     The lib script cannot know the depth sourced at - it does not know which index (0, or 1, ...)
#     to use against `BASH_SOURCE` array, but for the top-level caller it is always 0.
# *   `script_dir` should be set to absolute script dirname:
#     https://stackoverflow.com/a/246128/441652
#     script_dir="$( cd -- "$( dirname -- "${script_source}" )" &> /dev/null && pwd )"
#     by the caller before it changed dir anywhere.
#     This is the way to ensure the dir where the caller script resides.
# *   `argrelay_dir` should be set the `@/` (see FS_29_54_67_86) by the caller
#     because only the caller knew its relative path to the `argrelay_dir`
#     (that is the way to find location of this source this lib script).
