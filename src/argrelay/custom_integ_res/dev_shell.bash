# This is just a wrapper to start a new shell with special config and stay in that shell.
# Implements FS_58_61_77_69 dev_shell.

# Debug: Print commands before execution:
set -x
# Debug: Print commands after reading from a script:
set -v
# Return non-zero exit code from commands within a pipeline:
set -o pipefail
# Exit on non-zero exit code from a command:
set -e
# Inherit trap on ERR by sub-shells:
set -E
# Error on undefined variables:
set -u

# The dir of this script:
script_dir="$( cd -- "$( dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" &> /dev/null && pwd )"
