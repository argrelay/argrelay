# `argrelay` integration file: https://github.com/argrelay/argrelay
# It is configured via `@/conf/argrelay_rc_conf.bash`.

# This script is source-able by `~/.bashrc`:
#     source path/to/argrelay_dir/exe/argrelay_rc.bash

# The main purposes of this script:
# *   enable auto-completion for the commands configured via `argrelay_bind_command_basenames`
# *   add the commands to PATH

# Normally, this script is a symlink to orig artifact from `argrelay` distrib package.
# The path where this symlink (or copy) is located is supposed to contain:
# *   `@/bin/run_argrelay_client` artifact (generated by `@/exe/bootstrap_dev_env.bash`)
# *   `@/conf/argrelay_rc_conf.bash` defining `argrelay_bind_command_basenames` env var
# The symlinks for all command names are created by `@/exe/bootstrap_dev_env.bash` and
# point to `@/bin/run_argrelay_client`.

# Note that enabling exit on error (like `set -e` below) will exit parent Bash shell (as this one is sourced).
# Use these options with care as it prevents starting any shell in case of errors.

# Define with `s` in value to debug:
if [[ "${ARGRELAY_DEBUG-}" == *s* ]]
then
    set -x
    set -v
fi

    #       See output `history -p '!-1'` at this point - it is not equal the truly last command,
