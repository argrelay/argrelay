# `argrelay` integration file: https://github.com/argrelay/argrelay

# This script is source-able by `~/.bashrc`:
#     source path/to/argrelay_dir/exe/argrelay_rc.bash

# The main purposes of this script:
# *   enable auto-completion for the commands
# *   add commands to PATH

# Normally, this script is a symlink to orig artifact from `argrelay` distrib package.
# The path where this symlink (or copy) is located is supposed to contain:
# *   `@/bin/run_argrelay_client` artifact (generated by `@/exe/bootstrap_dev_env.bash`)
# *   `@/conf/argrelay_rc_conf.bash` defining `argrelay_bind_command_basenames` env var
# When it is sourced, it re-creates symlinks for all command names listed in `@/conf/argrelay_rc_conf.bash`
# (in `argrelay_bind_command_basenames` env var) into `@/bin/run_argrelay_client`.
# Then `argrelay` auto-completion is enabled for all of them.
# When sourced in `~/.bashrc`, this config becomes available in any new Bash instance.

# Note that enabling exit on error (like `set -e` below) will exit parent Bash shell (as this one is sourced).
# Use these options with care as it prevents starting any shell in case of errors.

# Debug: Print commands before execution:
#set -x
# Debug: Print commands after reading from a script:
#set -v
# Return non-zero exit code from commands within a pipeline:
#set -o pipefail
# Exit on non-zero exit code from a command:
#set -e
# Inherit trap on ERR by sub-shells:
#set -E
# Error on undefined variables:
#set -u

# It is expected that `@/exe/argrelay_rc.bash` is sourced from the project dir.
# The dir of this script:

    # Command line auto-completion process is largely similar to parsing command line args.
