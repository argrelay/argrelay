    Note: `RunMode` became completely implied and not necessary information for logic (derived from other values).

    See also `CallConv`.

    `RunMode` originates on the client side because of different user actions:
    *   `CompletionMode`: user hits `Tab` trying to complete command line arg.
    *   `InvocationMode`: user hits `Enter` trying to execute the command line.
    Request to `argrelay` server indicates the two different modes:
    *   `CompletionMode` - when shell asks `argrelay` server for suggestions to complete one command line arg.
    *   `InvocationMode` - when already executed command uses `argrelay` to determine values for all args.
    In other words:
    *   `CompletionMode` = (proposing options) collects all possible value options for the single arg under cursor.
    *   `InvocationMode` = (exercising options) selects only one value for specific arg, but does it for every arg.
    Also:
    *   `CompletionMode` excludes tangent token ("touched" by the cursor) as input to provide completion for it.
    *   `InvocationMode` includes tangent token as input arg to execute selected function.
